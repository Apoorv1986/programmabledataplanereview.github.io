  preamble: We divide the discussion of switch architectures into software and hardware switch architectures.
  categories:
    - name: Software Switch Architectures
      preamble: We first discuss the viability of software switching and then review dataflow graph abstractions, also discussing, e.g., Click, ClickOS, and software NICs. We proceed by revisiting literature on match-action abstractions, discussing OVS and PISCES. We conclude with a review on packet I/O libraries.

              title: Towards High Performance Virtual Routers on Commodity Hardware
              in: ACM CoNext '18
              year: 2018
              url: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1544012.1544032
              relevance: interesting
              desc: The paper is the first to study the performance limitations when building both software routers and software virtual routers on commodity CPU platforms. The authors observe that the fundamental performance bottleneck is the memory system, and that through careful mapping of tasks to CPU cores one can achieve very high forwarding rates. The authors also identify principles for the construction of high-performance software router systems on commodity hardware.

              relevance: interesting
              desc: RouteBricks is concerned with enabling high-speed parallel processing in software routers, using a software router architecture that parallelizes router functionality both across multiple servers and across multiple cores within a single server. RouteBricks adopts a fully programmable Click/Linux environment and is built entirely from off-the-shelf, general-purpose server hardware.

              desc: The paper introduces Snap, a framework for packet processing that exploits the parallelism available on modern GPUs, while remaining flexible, with packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion.

              desc: The paper introduces ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software middlebox platform. ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly (about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds), and over one hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a commodity server. A wide range of middleboxes is implemented, including a firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer, and the evaluations suggest that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.

              desc: BESS is the Berkeley Extensible Software Switch developed at the University of California, Berkeley and at Nefeli Networks. BESS is heavily inspired by the Click modular router, representing a packet processing pipeline as a dataflow (multi)graph that consists of modules, each of which implements a NIC feature, and ports that act as sources and sinks for this pipeline. Packets received at a port flow through the pipeline to another port, and each module in the pipeline performs module-specific operations on packets.

abstractions:
  name: Abstractions
  preamble: At the heart of programmable data planes lies the question of which abstractions and programming interfaces to provide. We first review literature on low-level APIs, including OpenFlow and P4, and then discuss more high-level languages and compilers, including DevoFlow and the Frenetic framework. Particular focus is put on stateful abstractions. We then extend our review to literature on parser design as well as scheduling, and in particular, the question whether there exist universal packet scheduling algorithms.

        We start our survey with the seminal paper on OpenFlow, introducing a standardized interface to manage flow table entries in data plane devices via a standard control-plane–data-plane API. We then proceed by discussing P4 and its alternatives and use cases. We also review, among other, high-performance packet processing languages and make the case for intermediate representations for programmable data planes.

        We then proceed to more high-level languages and abstractions, discuss programming languages such as Pyretic, systems such as Maple, or novel switch designs like HARMLESS to seamlessly add SDN capability to legacy network gear.

    - name: Abstractions for Embedded State
      preamble: While OpenFlow match/action table abstractions are stateless, there are many efforts toward devising a stateful data plane programming abstraction, e.g., based on finite state machines, for supporting more dynamic applications. We discuss such approaches as well as first workload characterizations of stateful networking applications. We also review literature on the challenge of consistent state migration and elastic scaling, and discuss security implications.

    - name: Programmable Parsing and Scheduling
      desc: We start by reviewing design principles for packet parsers. We then revisit the concept of a universal scheduler that would handle all queuing strategies that may arise in a programmable switch, and ask whether such a scheduling algorithm can really exist. We conclude with a review of fair queuing on reconfigurable switches.

  name: Applications
  preamble: |
    A main motivation for programmable data planes are the novel applications they enable. We identify and, in the following, will discuss five main categories: applications related to resilient and efficient forwarding, in-network computation, consensus, telemetry, and load-balancing.

    One may wonder, what aspects of SDN and programmable data plane make these applications possible? There is probably no single perfect answer to this question.

    Applications related to in-network computation typically leverage new hardware-assisted primitive operations, supported in the data plane, to provide novel functionality and improve performance. Resilient and efficient routing (and to some extent load-balancing) leverage the unique and unprecedented programmatic control over the way traffic flows through the network, e.g., to implement advanced functionality in the data plane (whereas formerly it used to be handled, e.g., in the control plane). Measurement applications benefit from the improved traffic visibility and/or from the improved latency and throughput at which high-volume and highly variable traffic can be handled, if offloaded to the data plane. Reduced latency and improved reaction time is arguably also a key reason for consensus applications. Furthermore, measurement applications benefit from the fact that they can be expressed in terms of simple primitives (e.g., sketches). We also note that such applications are not limited to be "performed (only) in the network": for example, telemetry can (and today often does) occur outside the network. That said, telemetry applications also benefit from the new visibility into the network, e.g., queues occupation levels of the switches along the path. Many interesting applications also arise from offloading applications that were formerly handled in a separate middlebox to programmable switches.

    In general, any application designed for a non-programmable device may benefit from the flexibilities introduced by a programmable counterpart (e.g., allowing to evolve the application). Also, applications with a strong networking component (e.g., request-response patterns) are more likely to benefit from in-network services, as much communication traffic naturally traverses the network anyway.

  categories:

    - name: Resilient, Robust, and Efficient Forwarding
      preamble: Data planes often operate much faster than the control plane, which motivates to move functionality for maintaining connectivity and efficient routing under failures to the switches. At the same time, implementing such functionality is non-trivial, as discussed in the following research papers.

    - name: Distributed Consensus
      preamble: |
        Another interesting application for programmable data planes is related to consensus algorithms: the coordination among controllers or switches may be performed most efficiently directly on the network devices. Over the last years, several interesting first approaches have been reported in the literature, not only to compute consensus but also to provide different notions of consistency more generally.
