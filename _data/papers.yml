  preamble: We divide the discussion of switch architectures into software and hardware switch architectures.
  categories:
    - name: Software Switch Architectures
      preamble: We first discuss the viability of software switching and then review dataflow graph abstractions, also discussing, e.g., Click, ClickOS, and software NICs. We proceed by revisiting literature on match-action abstractions, discussing OVS and PISCES. We conclude with a review on packet I/O libraries.

              title: Towards High Performance Virtual Routers on Commodity Hardware
              in: ACM CoNext
              year: 2018
              url: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1544012.1544032

              desc: The paper is the first to study the performance limitations when building both software routers and software virtual routers on commodity CPU platforms. The authors observe that the fundamental performance bottleneck is the memory system, and that through careful mapping of tasks to CPU cores one can achieve very high forwarding rates. The authors also identify principles for the construction of high-performance software router systems on commodity hardware.

              desc: The paper introduces the FlowStream switch architecture, which enables flow processing and forwarding at unprecedented flexibility and low cost by consolidating middlebox functionality, such as load balancing, packet inspection and intrusion detection, and commodity switch technologies, offering the possibility to control the switching of flows in a fine-grained manner, into a single integrated package deployed on commodity hardware.

              in: ACM SOSP

              relevance: interesting
              desc: RouteBricks is concerned with enabling high-speed parallel processing in software routers, using a software router architecture that parallelizes router functionality both across multiple servers and across multiple cores within a single server. RouteBricks adopts a fully programmable Click/Linux environment and is built entirely from off-the-shelf, general-purpose server hardware.

              desc: Introduces Click, a software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers from packet processing modules implementing simple router functions like packet classification, queuing, scheduling, organized into a directed graph with packet processing modules at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph.

              desc: The paper introduces Snap, a framework for packet processing that exploits the parallelism available on modern GPUs, while remaining flexible, with packet processing tasks implemented as simple modular elements that are composed to build fully functional routers and switches. Snap is based on the Click modular router, which it extends by adding new architectural features that support batched packet processing, memory structures optimized for offloading to coprocessors, and asynchronous scheduling with in-order completion.

              title: ClickOS and the Art of Network Function Virtualization

              desc: The paper introduces ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software middlebox platform. ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly (about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds), and over one hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a commodity server. A wide range of middleboxes is implemented, including a firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer, and the evaluations suggest that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.

              desc: BESS is the Berkeley Extensible Software Switch developed at the University of California, Berkeley and at Nefeli Networks. BESS is heavily inspired by the Click modular router, representing a packet processing pipeline as a dataflow (multi)graph that consists of modules, each of which implements a NIC feature, and ports that act as sources and sinks for this pipeline. Packets received at a port flow through the pipeline to another port, and each module in the pipeline performs module-specific operations on packets.
