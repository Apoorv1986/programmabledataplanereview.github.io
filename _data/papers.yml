  preamble: We divide the discussion of switch architectures into software and hardware switch architectures.
  categories:
    - name: Software Switch Architectures
      preamble: We first discuss the viability of software switching and then review dataflow graph abstractions, also discussing, e.g., Click, ClickOS, and software NICs. We proceed by revisiting literature on match-action abstractions, discussing OVS and PISCES. We conclude with a review on packet I/O libraries.

              title: Towards High Performance Virtual Routers on Commodity Hardware
              in: ACM CoNext
              year: 2018
              url: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1544012.1544032
              relevance: interesting
              desc: The paper is the first to study the performance limitations when building both software routers and software virtual routers on commodity CPU platforms. The authors observe that the fundamental performance bottleneck is the memory system, and that through careful mapping of tasks to CPU cores one can achieve very high forwarding rates. The authors also identify principles for the construction of high-performance software router systems on commodity hardware.

              desc: The paper introduces the FlowStream switch architecture, which enables flow processing and forwarding at unprecedented flexibility and low cost by consolidating middlebox functionality, such as load balancing, packet inspection and intrusion detection, and commodity switch technologies, offering the possibility to control the switching of flows in a fine-grained manner, into a single integrated package deployed on commodity hardware.

              desc: Introduces Click, a software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers from packet processing modules implementing simple router functions like packet classification, queuing, scheduling, organized into a directed graph with packet processing modules at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph.
